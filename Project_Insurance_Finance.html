        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <strong>Who Am I?</strong>
        <p>
            I am a Financial Services professional helping families and business owners protect their lives, businesses, and assets so they can live confidently and achieve long-term goals.
            I specialize in understanding unique situations and designing solutions that address multiple financial needs—protection, growth, and stability.
            As a business owner, I am also passionate about helping others build their own financial services businesses and create sustainable, passive income.
        </p>

        <strong>Who Are You?</strong>
        <p>
            You are an individual or business owner working hard to grow your career or business while taking care of your family and personal responsibilities.
            You may be busy, focused on day-to-day demands, and unsure whether your current financial strategies fully protect you from unexpected risks—or support the future you are working toward.
        </p>

      <section id="challenges">
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Income Security:</strong>
            Do you truly control your income? If you were unable to work today, how long could your savings support you, and how would this affect your retirement plans?
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Protection Gaps:</strong>
            Do you have sufficient financial protection? What would happen to you and your family if you lost your job or income?
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Appropriate Coverage:</strong>
            Is your insurance aligned with your needs? Do you have the right mix of term, universal, or whole life coverage?
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Financial Literacy & Awareness:</strong>
            Do you understand the fundamentals of personal finance—such as assets vs. liabilities, interest rates, rate of return, tax implications, and the power of compounding over time?
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Investment Strategy:</strong>
            Building wealth is not determined by income alone. Are you investing consistently, regardless of income level, and contributing regularly toward long-term goals?
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Performance & Growth:</strong>
            Are your investments working efficiently for you? Are you confident that your rate of return, fees, and tax efficiency align with your long-term financial objectives?
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Retirement Readiness:</strong>
            Many households lack financial preparedness: 3 in 10 middle-class families live paycheck to paycheck, 30% lack life insurance protection, and 41% of Gen-Xers have not saved for retirement.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </section>
